# primos-log-parser



The Primos is as solar thermal controller manufactured by [prozeda](https://prozeda.de/en/product-details/primos-250-sr-2/). The device has an SD card slot that can be used to log sensor readings but unfortunately this log is in a binary format that requires a windows only program to view the data.

This project is an attempt to reverse the binary format and allows you to extract data programmatically and use in your own home automation projects.

You should be able to read logs for any of the other primos devices but as I only have access 250 to test with so any PR's to expand functionality are welcome.
